#Introdution to Trusted Computing#

###Target###
To understand how to use the embedded security subsystem(TPM) built into many computers to solve the insecure problems.
<br />

###Why Software Can't Be Made Completely Secure?###
<ol>
Modern systems are complex, have billions of lines of code. The fact that one security-related bug per thousand lines of source code makes a software insecure.
Compatibility.
Hard to detect the presence of malicious code in the system without hardware support.
</ol>

###How Can the TPM Help?###
<ul>
Private keys cannot be stolen or given away.
The addition of malicious code is always detected.
Malicious code is prevented from using the private keys.
Encryption keys are not easily available to a physical thief.
</ul>
