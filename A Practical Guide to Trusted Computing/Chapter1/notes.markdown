#Introdution to Trusted Computing#

###Target###
To understand how to use the embedded security subsystem(TPM) built into many computers to solve the insecure problems.
<br />

###Why Software Can't Be Made Completely Secure?###
1.Modern systems are complex, have billions of lines of code. The fact that one security-related bug per thousand lines of source code makes a software insecure.<br />
2.Compatibility.<br />
3.Hard to detect the presence of malicious code in the system without hardware support.<br />

###How Can the TPM Help?###
*Private keys cannot be stolen or given away.<br />
*The addition of malicious code is always detected.<br />
*Malicious code is prevented from using the private keys.<br />
*Encryption keys are not easily available to a physical thief.<br />
